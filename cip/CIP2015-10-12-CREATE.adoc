This proposal formalizes `CREATE` which is used in Cypher to create nodes and relationships.
--

toc::[]

== Motivation & Background
`CREATE` is how nodes and relationships are created in Cypher.
The syntax has been around since the very beginning of Cypher but never properly formalized.
With 3.0 on the horizon we want to make sure `CREATE` fits with the rest of the language, and make sure it is future proof.

== Proposal

`CREATE` will in a lot of aspects work as it does in the current implementation, but this proposal cleans the `CREATE` syntax up a bit.

=== Examples

[source, cypher]
.Create a single node.
----
CREATE ()
----

[source, cypher]
.Create a node and set two labels and one property on it.
----
CREATE (:Person:Administrator { email: 'mats@neotechnology.com' })
----

[source, cypher]
.Create a relationship of type `KNOWS` between all `:Person` nodes.
----
MATCH (a:Person), (b:Person)
CREATE (a)-[:KNOWS]->(b)
----

[source, cypher]
.Create two nodes and one relationship between them.
----
CREATE (me:Source), (you:Destination), (you)<-[:LOVES]-(me)
----

[source, cypher]
.Create multiple nodes with properties from a parameter list of maps.
----
UNWIND { mapList } AS map
CREATE (n:Node)
SET n = map
----

[source, cypher]
// It seems the . operator doesn't allow multiple lines, and we want two sentences here.
.Create two nodes with properties from two parameter maps. Parameter keys and values will be the same as those of the map.
----
CREATE (:Cat {catProps})
CREATE (:Dog {dogProps})
----

=== Syntax
[source, ebnf]
----
create       = "CREATE", {pattern}, [{",", pattern}] ;
pattern      = node-pattern | rel-pattern ;
node-pattern = "(", [identifier], [{label}], [property], ")" ;
rel-pattern  = "(", identifier, ")", in-rel | out-rel, "(", identifier, ")" ;
out-rel      = "-[", [identifier], type, [property], "]->" ;
in-rel       = "<-[", [identifier], type, [property], "]-" ;
label        = ":", identifier ;
type         = label ;
property     = "{", param | {identifier, ":", literal | param}, "}" ;
param        = "{", identifier, "}" ;
literal      = string | number ;
----

=== Semantics

`CREATE` is used to create new nodes and relationships in the graph.
Each `CREATE` will create exactly one node or one relationship between two pre-existing nodes per row.
`CREATE` has no return value, and ending a query with a `CREATE` clause will yield an empty result.

=== Interaction with existing features

`CREATE` on a node pattern will cause the query to fail in the commit phase if the to-be-created node would violate a uniqueness constraint in the database.

This proposal drops some functionality around how we handle creating nodes and relationships:

- `CREATE (a {param})` where `{param}` is a list of maps where one node is created for each item  of the list.
We propose to remove this usage.

- `CREATE (a:L {prop: 42})-[:R]->(b:B)` where both nodes and relationships are created from the same pattern.
With this proposal one would have to be more specific and write `CREATE (a:L {prop:42}), (b:B), (a)-[:R]->(b)`.

We believe that the implicit creation of nodes when specifying a relationship pattern is causing more complexity than whatever benefit it provides to the user, and thus forcing the user to be specific about what to create will benefit both users and implementors of Cypher.

=== Alternatives
The main alternative is to leave the functionality the way it is in Neo4j versions prior to 3.0.

== What others do

- SQL has `CREATE TABLE` for creating tables and `INSERT` for creating new records in a table.
- MongoDB has `create: <collection_name>` for creating documents.
- In SPARQL, you use `INSERT DATA` to add triples.

== Benefits to this proposal

Since `CREATE` already exists in the language, this CIP doesn't introduce any new features, the goal is rather to send `CREATE` through a formalization process.
Hopefully this will enable us to clearly specify the behavior we want `CREATE` to have.
A formal document such as this one could be of good value for a future language specification effort.
The ideas we present to constrain the `CREATE` syntax could also become valuable changes to the language in being slightly more restrictive and thus slightly easier to understand.

== Caveats to this proposal

Not all syntax changes will have time to become deprecated in Cypher 2.3.0, but will have to be deprecated in a 2.3.x release.
This may or may not cause disturbance for users.
