This CIP redefines and formalizes 4 key language concepts, *comparability* and *equality*, as well as *orderability* and *equivalence*. While these notions already exist in the language today, they have never been defined explicitly.
Furthermore the current definitions are somewhat misaligned with each other.
This leads to inconsistencies and an unnecessarily complicated conceptual model.
In summary, this CIP proposes some changes to how Cypher defines these four concepts in order to get a consistent set of rules and also proposes to align comparability with equality, as well as orderability with equivalence to provide a simpler conceptual model.
It also gives a brief definition of aggregation and standard aggregation functions.

== Motivation

There are currently a number of limitations and inconsistencies that this proposal aims to address:

1. Cypher already has good semantics for equality within the primitive types (booleans, strings, integers, and floats) and maps.
Furthermore, Cypher has good semantics for comparability and orderability for integers, floats, and strings, within each of the types.
However working with values of different types can be difficult:

  * Comparability between values of different types is often undefined. This stops query execution instead of allowing graceful recovery. This problem is particularly pronounced when it occurs as part of the evaluation of predicates (in `WHERE`).
  * `ORDER BY` will often fail with an error if the values passed to it have different types.

2. The underlying conceptual model is complex and sometimes inconsistent. This leads to an unclear relationship between comparison operators, equality, grouping, and `ORDER BY`:

  * Comparability and orderability are not aligned with each other consistently, as some types may be ordered but not compared.
  * There are various inconsistencies around equality (and equivalence) semantics as exposed by `IN`, `=`, `DISTINCT`, and grouping.
  The difference between equality and equivalence in Cypher today is small and subtle, and limited to testing two instances of the value `null` to each other.

  ** In equality, `null = null` is `null`.
  ** In equivalence, used by `DISTINCT` and when grouping values, two `null` values are always treated as being the same value.
  ** However, equality treats `null` values differently if they are an element of a list or a map value.
  ** Similar rules apply for `NaN` values.

Furthermore, the key concepts comparability, orderability, equality, and equivalence have never been defined properly.  Therefore another motivation for this CIP is to unambiguously and precisely define these 4 concepts.

== Background

The reader should be mindful of the Cypher type system when reading this CIP. At the time of this proposal, the latest CIP regarding the Cypher type system is: https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher/blob/master/cip/CIP2015-09-16-public-type-system-type-annotation.adoc[`CIP2015-09-16-public-type-system-type-annotation`].

== Proposal

We propose to redefine <<comparability-def>> and <<equality-def>>, as well as <<orderability-def>> and <<equivalence-def>> as detailed in this section, and additionally rephrase <<aggregation,aggregation>> in terms of these new concepts.

[[concepts]]
=== Concepts

Cypher today features four distinct concepts related to equality and ordering:

[horizontal]
[[comparability-con,comparability (concept)]]*Comparability*:: <<comparability-def,Comparability>> is used by the inequality operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `\<=`), and defines the underlying semantics of how to compare two values.
[[equality-con,equality (concept)]]*Equality*:: <<equality-def,Equality>> is used by the equality operators (`=`, `<>`), and the list membership operator (`IN`).
It defines the underlying semantics to determine if two values are the same in these contexts.
Equality is also used implicitly by literal maps in node and relationship patterns, since such literal maps are merely a shorthand notation for equality predicates.
[[orderability-con,orderability (concept)]]*Orderability*:: <<orderability-def,Orderability>> is used by the `ORDER BY` clause, and defines the underlying semantics of how to order values.
[[equivalence-con,equivalence (concept)]]*Equivalence*:: <<equivalence-def,Equivalence>> is used by the `DISTINCT` modifier and by grouping in projection clauses (`WITH`, `RETURN`), and defines the underlying semantics to determine if two values are the same in these contexts.

==== The meaning of `null`

For the following discussion, it is helpful to clarify the meaning of `null`. In Cypher, a `null` value has one of two meanings, depending on the context in which it occurs:

[horizontal]
[[unknown-null,unknown `null`]]*Unknown*:: An "unknown" `null` is taken to be a placeholder for an arbitrary but unknown value. When evaluating predicates, an "unknown" `null` is the `maybe` truth value of ternary logic. For node and relationship properties, an "unknown" `null` is a value that is definite in the real world but has not been stored in the graph. Since in these cases, two "unknown" `null` values stand for arbitrary but definite values in the real world, two "unknown" `null` values should never be treated as certainly being the same value.
[[missing-null,missing `null`]]*Missing*:: A "missing" `null` is taken to be a marker for the absence of a value. In the context of updating node properties from a map, a "missing" `null` is used to mark properties that are to be removed. In the context of `DISTINCT` and grouping, a "missing" `null` value is used as grouping key for all records that miss a more specific value. Since in these cases, two "missing" `null` values represent the same concept, they should always be treated as the same value.

[[regular-map]]
==== Regular maps

Cypher today has one supertype `MAP` for all map values. This includes nodes (of subtype `NODE`), relationships (of subtype `RELATIONSHIP`), and any other map (not captured by a subtype of `MAP`). For the purpose of this document, we define a regular map to be any value of type `MAP` that is neither a `NODE` nor a `RELATIONSHIP`.

[[comparability-equality,comparability and equality]]
=== Comparability and equality

We propose that comparability and equality should be aligned with each other, i.e.

`expr1 = expr2` if and only if `expr1 >= expr2 && expr1 \<= expr2`.

Comparability and equality produce <<unknown-null,"unknown" `null` values>>.

[[incomparable,incomparable]]
==== Incomparability

If and only if every comparison and equality test involving a specific value evaluates to `null`, this value is said to be incomparable.

Furthermore, if every comparison or equality test between two specific values evaluates to `null`, theses values are said to be incomparable with each other.

[[comparability-def,comparability]]
==== Comparability

We propose that <<comparability-con,comparability>> should be defined between any pair of values, as specified below.

- General rules
  * Values are only comparable within their most specific type (except for numbers, see below).
  * Equal values are grouped together.
- Numbers
  * Integers are compared numerically in ascending order.
  * Floats (excluding `NaN` values and the Infinities) are compared numerically in ascending order.
  * Numbers of different types (excluding `NaN` values and the Infinities) are compared to each other as if both numbers would have been coerced to arbitrary precision big decimals (currently outside the Cypher type system) before comparing them with each other numerically in ascending order.
  * Positive infinity is of type `FLOAT`, equal to itself and greater than any other number (excluding `NaN` values).
  * Negative infinity is of type `FLOAT`, equal to itself and less than any other number (excluding `NaN` values).
  * `NaN` values are <<incomparable>>.
  * Numbers are <<incomparable>> to any value that is not also a number.
- Booleans
  * Booleans are compared such that `false` is less than `true`.
  * Booleans are <<incomparable>> to any value that is not also a boolean.
- Strings
  * Strings are compared in dictionary order, i.e. characters are compared pairwise in ascending order from the start of the string to the end.
  Characters missing in a shorter string are considered to be less than any other character.
  For example, `'a' < 'aa'`.
  * Strings are <<incomparable>> to any value that is not also a string.
- Lists
  * Lists are compared in dictionary order, i.e. list elements are compared pairwise in ascending order from the start of the list to the end. Elements missing in a shorter list are considered to be less than any other value (including `null` values).
  For example, `[1] < [1, 0]` but also `[1] < [1, null]`.
  * If comparing two lists requires comparing at least a single `null` value to some other value, these lists are <<incomparable>>.
  For example, `[1, 2] >= [1, null]` evaluates to `null`.
  * Lists are <<incomparable>> to any value that is not also a list.
- Maps
  * [[regular-maps,regular maps]]Regular maps
  ** The comparison order for maps is unspecified and left to implementations.
  ** The comparison order for maps must align with the <<equality-def,equality semantics>> outlined below.
  In consequence, any map that contains an entry that maps its key to a `null` value is <<incomparable>>.
  For exampe, `{a: 1} \<= {a: 1, b: null}` evaluates to `null`.
  ** Regular maps are <<incomparable>> to any value that is not also a regular map.
  * Nodes
  ** The comparison order for nodes is based on an implementation specific internal total order of node identities.
  ** Nodes are <<incomparable>> to any value that is not also a node.
  * Relationships
  ** The comparison order for relationships is based on an implementation specific internal total order of relationship identities.
  ** Relationships are <<incomparable>> to any value that is not also a relationship.
- Paths
  ** Paths are compared as if they were a list of alternating nodes and relationships of the path from the start node to the end node.
  For example, given nodes `n1`, `n2`, `n3`, and relationships `r1` and `r2`, and given that `n1 < n2 < n3` and `r1 < r2`, then the path `p1` from `n1` to `n3` via `r1` would be less than the path `p2` to `n1` from `n2` via `r2`. Expressed in terms of lists:

      p1 < p2
  <=> [n1, r1, n3] < [n1, r2, n2]
  <=> n1 < n1 || (n1 = n1 && [r1, n3] < [r2, n2])
  <=> false || (true && [r1, n3] < [r2, n2])
  <=> [r1, n3] < [r2, n2]
  <=> r1 < r2 || (r1 = r2 && n3 < n2)
  <=> true || (false && false)
  <=> true

  ** Paths are <<incomparable>> to any value that is not also a path.
- Implementation-specific types
  * Implementations may choose to define suitable comparability rules for values of additional, non-canonical types.
  * Values of an additional, non-canonical type are expected to be <<incomparable>> to values of a canonical type.
- Temporal instant types (DateTime, LocalDateTime, Date, Time, LocalTime)
  * Temporal instant values are only comparable within types.
  * Given two instants `a` and `b`, `a < b` is `true` iff `a` is _before_ `b`, +
    conversely `a > b` is `true` iff `a` is _after_ `b`.
  * Temporal instant values with timezone (DateTime and LocalTime) are compared on a global timeline, as if the instants were normalized to UTC.
- Durations
  * Durations are not comparable, and can thus only be tested for equality.
  * Inequality comparisons (`<` and `>`) between durations yield `null`.
- `null` is <<incomparable>> with any other value (including other `null` values).

[[equality-def,equality]]
==== Equality ====

In order to align equality with <<comparability-def>>, we change equality of lists and maps that contain `null` values to treat those values in the same way as if they would have been compared outside of those lists and maps, as individual, simple values.

===== List equality =====

Specifically, we propose to redefine how equality works for lists in Cypher.
To determine if two lists `l1` and `l2` are equal, we propose two simple tests, as exemplified by the following:

* `l1` and `l2` must have the same size, i.e. inversely `size(l1) <> size(l2) \=> l1 <> l2`
* the pairwise elements of both `l1` and `l2` must be equal, i.e.
----
[a1, a2, ..., an] = [b1, b2, ..., bn]
<=>
a1 = b1 && a2 = b2 && ... && an = bn
----

===== Map equality =====

====== Current map equality ======
For clarity, we also repeat the *current* equality semantics of maps here. Under these current semantics, two maps `m1` and `m2` are considered equal if:

* `m1` and `m2` have the same keys,
** including keys that map to a `null` value (the order of keys as returned by `keys()` does not matter here).
* Additionally, for each such key `k`,
** either `m1.k = m2.k` is `true`,
** or both `m1.k IS NULL` and `m2.k IS NULL`

This is at odds with the decision to produce <<unknown-null,"unknown" `null` values>> in <<comparability-equality>>.

However, this definition is aligned with the most common use case for maps with `null` entries: updating multiple properties through the use of a single `SET` clause, e.g. `SET n += { size: 12, remove_this_key: null }`. In this case, there is no need to differentiate between different `null` values, as `null` merely serves as a marker for keys to be removed (i.e. is a <<missing-null,"missing" `null` value>>). Current equality semantics make it easy to check if two maps would correspond to the same property update in this scenario. We note though that this type of update map comparison is rare and could be emulated using a more complex predicate. The current rules do however break symmetry with how equality handles `null` in all other cases. This becomes more apparent by considering these two examples:

* `expr1 = expr2` evaluates to `null` if `expr1 IS NULL && expr2 IS NULL`
* `{a: expr1} = {a: expr2}` evaluates to `true` if `expr1 IS NULL && expr2 IS NULL`

====== New map equality ======

To rectify this, we propose instead that two maps `m1` and `m2` should be equal if:

* `m1` and `m2` have the same keys,
** including keys that map to a `null` value (the order of keys as returned by `keys()` does not matter here).
* Additionally, for each such key `k`,
** `m1.k = m2.k` is `true`.

As a consequence of these changes, plain <<equality-def>> is not reflexive for all values (consider: `{a: null} = {a: null}`, `[null] = [null]`). However this was already the case (consider: `null = null` \=> `null`).

Note that <<equality-def>> is reflexive for values that do not involve `null` though.

[[orderability-equivalence]]
=== Orderability and equivalence ===

We propose that <<orderability-def>> and <<equivalence-def>> should be aligned with each other, i.e.

`expr1` is equivalent to `expr2` if and only if they have the same position under orderability (i.e. they would be sorted before (or after respectively) any other non-equivalent value in the same way).

Orderability and equivalence produce <<missing-null,"missing" `null` values>>.

[[orderability-def,orderability]]
==== Orderability ====

[[global-sort-order,global sort order]]
We propose that orderability be defined between any pair of values such that the result is always `true` or `false`.

To accomplish this, we propose a pre-determined order of types and ensure that each value falls under exactly one disjoint type in this order.
We define the following ascending global sort order of disjoint types:

* `MAP` types
** <<regular-map,Regular map>>
** `NODE`
** `RELATIONSHIP`
* `LIST OF ANY?`
* `PATH`
* `DATETIME`
* `LOCALDATETIME`
* `DATE`
* `TIME`
* `LOCALTIME`
* `DURATION`
* `STRING`
* `BOOLEAN`
* `NUMBER`
** `NaN` values are treated as the largest numbers in orderability only (i.e. they are put after positive infinity)
* `VOID` (i.e. the type of `null`)

To give a concrete example, under this global sort order all nodes come before all strings.

Between values of the same type in the global sort order, orderability defers to comparability except that equality is overridden by equivalence as described below.
For example, `[null, 1]` is ordered before `[null, 2]` under orderability.
Additionally, for the container types, elements of the containers use orderability, not comparability, to determine the order between them.
For example, `[1, 'foo', 3]` is ordered before `[1, 2, 'bar']` since `'foo'` is ordered before `2`.

Furthermore, the values of additional, non-canonical types must not be inserted after `NaN` values in the global sort order.

The accompanying descending global sort order is the same order in reverse (i.e. it runs from `VOID` to `MAP`).

[[equivalence-def,equivalence]]
==== Equivalence ====

Equivalence now can be defined succinctly as being identical to equality except that:

* Any two `null` values are equivalent (both directly or inside nested structures).
* Any two `NaN` values are equivalent (both directly or inside nested structures).
* However, `null` and `NaN` values are not equivalent (both directly or inside nested structures).
* Equivalence of lists is identical to equality of lists but uses equivalence for comparing the contained list elements.
* Equivalence of regular maps is identical to equality of regular maps but uses equivalence for comparing the contained map entries.

Equivalence is reflexive for all values.

[[aggregation]]
=== Aggregation ===

Generally an aggregation `aggr(expr)` processes all matching rows for each aggregation key found in an incoming record (keys are compared using equivalence).

For a fixed aggregation key and each matching record, `expr` is evaluated to a value.
This yields a list of candidate values.
Generally the order of candidate values is unspecified.
If the aggregation happens in a projection with an associated `ORDER BY` subclause, the list of candidate values is ordered in the same way as the underlying records and as specified by the associated `ORDER BY` subclause.

In a regular aggregation (i.e. of the form `aggr(expr)`), the list of aggregated values is the list of candidate values with all `null` values removed from it.

In a distinct aggregation (i.e. of the form `aggr(DISTINCT expr)`), the list of aggregated values is the list of candidate values with all `null` values removed from it.
Furthermore, in a distinct aggregation, only one of all equivalent candidate values is included in the list of aggregated values, i.e. duplicates under equivalence are removed.
However, if the distinct aggregation happens in a projection with an associated `ORDER BY` subclause, only one element from each set of equivalent candidate values is included in the list of aggregated values.

Finally, the remaining aggregated values are processed by the actual aggregation function.
If the list of aggregated values is empty, the aggregation function returns a default value (`null` unless specified otherwise below).
Aggregating values of different types (like summing a number and a string) may lead to runtime errors.

The semantics of a few actual aggregation functions depends on the used notions of sameness and sorting. This is clarified below:

* `count(expr)` returns the number of aggregated values, or `0` if the list of aggregated values is empty.
* `min/max(expr)` returns the smallest (and largest respectively) of the aggregated values under orderability. Note that `null` values will never be returned as a maximum as they are never included in the list of aggregated values.
* `sum(expr)` returns the sum of aggregated values, or `0` if the list of aggregated values is empty.
* `avg(expr)` returns the arithmetic mean of aggregated values, or `0` if the list of aggregated values is empty.
* `collect(expr)` returns the list of aggregated values.
* `stdev(expr)` returns the standard deviation of the aggregated values (assuming they represent a random sample), or `0` if the list of aggregated values is empty.
* `stdevp(expr)` returns the standard deviation of the aggregated values (assuming they form a complete population), or `0` if the list of aggregated values is empty.
* `percentile_disc(expr)` computes the inverse distribution function (assuming a discrete distribution model), or `0` if the list of aggregated values is empty.
* `percentile_cont(expr)` computes the inverse distribution function (assuming a continous distribution model), or `0` if the list of aggregated values is empty.

[[conceptual-model]]
=== Summary of the conceptual model ===

This proposal aims to simplify the conceptual model around equality, comparison, order, and grouping:

- <<comparability-equality,Comparability and equality>> are aligned with each other
  * <<equality-con,Equality>> follows natural, literal equality. However, values involving `null` are never equal to any other value. Nested structures are first tested for equality by shape (keys, size) and then their corresponding elements are tested for equality pairwise. This ensures that equality is compatible with interpreting `null` as "unknown" or "could be any value".
  * <<comparability-con,Comparability>> ensure that any two values of the same type in the <<global-sort-order>> are comparable.
  Two values of different types are incomparable and values involving `null` are incomparable, too.
  This ensures that `MATCH (n) WHERE n.prop < 42` will never find nodes where `n.prop` is of type `STRING`.
- <<orderability-equivalence>> are aligned with each other
  * <<equivalence-con,Equivalence>> is a form of equality that treats `null` (and `NaN`) values as the same value. Equivalence is used in grouping and `DISTINCT` where `null` commonly is interpreted as a category marker for results with missing values instead of as a wildcard for any possible value.
  * <<orderability-con,Orderability>> follows comparability but additionally defines a <<global-sort-order>> between values of different types and is aligned with equivalence instead of equality, i.e. treats two `null` (respectively `NaN`) values as equivalent.
- Aggregation functions that rely on notions of sameness and sorting are aligned with equivalence and orderability.

[[examples]]
=== Examples

RETURN i
  ORDER BY i

=== Interaction with existing features

Changing <<equality-def>> to treat lists and maps containing `null` as unequal is going to potentially filter out more rows when used in a predicate.

Redefining the <<global sort order>> as well as making all values <<comparability-def,comparable>> will change some currently failing queries to pass.

=== Alternatives

Columns in SQL always have a concrete type. This removes the need to define a <<global-sort-order>> between types. Standard SQL has no support for lists, maps, or graph structures and hence does not need to define semantics for them.
SQL also treats comparisons involving `null` as returning `null`.

PostgresSQL treats some numerical operations (such as division by zero) that would compute a `NaN` value as a numerical error that causes the query to fail.
PostgresQL considers `NaN` values to be greater than positive infinity, both in comparison and in sort order.
This proposal achieves something very similar by evaluating comparisons involving a `NaN` to `null` and by treating both `NaN` values as the largest numbers and `null` values as the largest values in the <<global-sort-order>>.

This proposal could be extended with an operator for making equivalence accessible beyond use in grouping and `DISTINCT`. This seems desirable due to the equality operator (`=`) not being reflexive for all values.

This CIP introduces the distinction between "unknown" and "missing" `null` values. A future proposal could investigate making this explicit through the introduction of different kinds of `null` values. If such a change would be adopted and <<unknown-null,unknown `null` values>> would track their source, equality could become "more" reflexive as it would become possible to know if two `null` values represent the same "unknown" value. However, this would not remove the need to distinguish between equality and equivalence as grouping would still require `missing = unknown => true` while in general `missing = unknown => missing`.

== Benefits to this proposal

A consistent set of rules is defined for <<equality-con,equality>>, <<equivalence-con,equivalence>>, <<comparability-con,comparability>> and <<orderability-con,orderability>>.

Furthermore, aggregation semantics are clarified and this proposal prepares the replacement (or reinterpretation) of `NaN` values as `null` values in the future.

== Caveats to this proposal

Adopting this proposal may break some queries; specifically queries that depend on equality semantics of lists containing `null` values.
It should be noted that we expect that most lists used in queries are constructed using `collect()`, which never outputs `null` values.

This proposal changes path equality in subtle ways, namely loops track the direction in which they are traversed.
It may be helpful to add a path normalization function or path to entities conversion function in the future that allows to transform a path in a way that removes this semantic distinction.

== Appendix: Comparability by Type

The following table captures which types may be compared with each other such that the outcome is either `true` or `false`.
Any other comparison will always yield  a`null` value (except when comparing `NaN` values which are handled as described above).
