Feature: MatchWhere1 - Filter single variable

  Scenario: Filter node with property predicate
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE ({name: 'bar'})
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n)
      WHERE n.name = 'bar'
      RETURN n
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | n               |
      | ({name: 'bar'}) |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: Filter relationship with property predicate
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:A)<-[:KNOWS {name: 'monkey'}]-()-[:KNOWS {name: 'woot'}]->(:B)
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (node)-[r:KNOWS]->(a)
      WHERE r.name = 'monkey'
      RETURN a
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | a    |
      | (:A) |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: Filter node with disjunctive property predicate
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (a:A {p1: 12}),
        (b:B {p2: 13}),
        (c:C)

      MATCH (n)
      WHERE n.p1 = 12 OR n.p2 = 13
      RETURN n
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | n             |
      | (:A {p1: 12}) |
      | (:B {p2: 13}) |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: Filter relationship with disjunctive relationship type predicate
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
