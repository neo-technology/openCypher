Feature: CineastsDependent

  Background:
    Given the cineasts graph

  Scenario: Make query from existing database
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n)
      RETURN count(n)
      """
    Then the result should be:
      | count(n) |
      | 10708    |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: Support multiple divisions in aggregate function
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (n)
      RETURN count(n)/60/60 AS count
      """
    Then the result should be:
      | count |
      | 2     |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: Support column renaming for aggregates as well
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a:Person)
      WHERE a.id = '4785'
      RETURN count(*) AS ColumnName
      """
    Then the result should be:
      | ColumnName |
      | 1          |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: Run coalesce
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a:User)
      WHERE a.name = 'Emil Eifrem'
      RETURN coalesce(a.title, a.name)
      """
    Then the result should be:
      | coalesce(a.title, a.name) |
      | 'Emil Eifrem'             |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: Allow addition
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a:Person)
      WHERE a.id = '1769'
      RETURN a.version + 5
      """
    Then the result should be:
      | a.version + 5 |
      | 102           |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: Functions should return null if they get path containing unbound
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH null AS a
      OPTIONAL MATCH p = (a)-[r]->()
      RETURN length(nodes(p)), id(r), type(r), nodes(p), rels(p)
      """
    Then the result should be:
      | length(nodes(p)) | id(r) | type(r) | nodes(p) | rels(p) |
      | null             | null  | null    | null     | null    |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: Aggregates inside normal functions
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a)
      RETURN length(collect(a))
      """
    Then the result should be:
      | length(collect(a)) |
      | 10708              |
    And no side effects
