Feature: ReturnAcceptance2

  Scenario: Multiple aliasing and backreferencing
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      CREATE (m {id: 0})
      WITH {first: m.id} AS m
      WITH {second: m.first} AS m
      RETURN m.second
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | m.second |
      | 0        |
    And the side effects should be:
      | +nodes      | 1 |
      | +properties | 1 |
