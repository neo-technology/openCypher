= Cypher version 9

== Background

During the 5th openCypher Implementers Group call (oCIG 5), a proposal for versioning was presented, which included the specification of Cypher 9 as the first official standard version of Cypher.
Cypher 9 is a draft baseline specification which references a number of sources to craft a distributed specification for Cypher.
These sources are enumerated in this document.

== Specification

Cypher 9 does not have a unified single source of truth, but contains references to pieces of documentation that describe parts of the Cypher language.
