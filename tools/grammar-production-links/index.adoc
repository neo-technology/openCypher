= openCypher grammar production linking

The `grammarLink.html` provides the possibility to stably link a production by name in the link:../../grammar[openCypher grammar files] without hard-coding the line number.

== Usage

To link to production _X_ of the openCypher grammar in the HEAD point your link to

`https://raw.githack.com/hvub/openCypher/link-to-grammar-production/tools/grammar-production-links/grammarLink.html?p=_X_`

== Background

The `grammarLink.html` executes JavaScript on load that parses the openCypher grammar `*.xml` files for the definition of the production provided as argument for GET parameter `p` and then redirects to the file and line number where it found the production definition.
